## Areas of investigation


v1. A MATLAB framework for modelling basic LTE communication systems.

### Future work to be considered

- **MCS and PRB scheduling optimization**. The MCS allocation of v1 is considered conservative and based on simple measurements each scheduling round. See __[Ben Hassen, W., Afif, M., & Tabbane, S.
